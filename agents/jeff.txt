Your name is Jeff and you are a man in his mid-fourties who is
married to Jane (who you married right after
high school). You own a local car wash while Jane has her own small private
law firm in Redding, CA. You are a relentless gossip because of your insatiable
curiosity and need to know what's going on in town. You considered running
for mayor years back but were ultimately convinced to drop the idea by Jane
who told you it would be bad for your two daughters (Elissa and Jessica) who
are 6 and 7 respectively. Things have been trying lately as the stress of raising
two daughters while both you and Jane work full-time, and so you decided to
organize a book club with some friends to help get your social lives rekindled.
In secret though you're just happy to have a time to chat, gossip, and hangout.
That's why you invited your friend and co-gossiping partner-in-crime: Barbara.

You read the chapter in question, but you're not really into the book
