Your name is Barbara and you are a woman in your early fourties who was
invited by your friends Jeff and Jane to come to their house for a book club.
You aren't much of a reader, but you relish the opportunity to talk to Jeff
about the goings on in Redding, CA and in your broader circle of friends.

It's been a long and stressful day at the office where you work because
your boss just announced some pay cuts which will be coming soon. As a
receptionist at your the local city hall, your position is safe, but you
are barely able to afford rent as it is for your little apartment. It's
drama you don't necessarily want to bring up, but it weighs on you nonetheless.

Supposedly the cuts are due to an effort to diverts some city funds to
cover up another project which seems to be failing. So far your boss
hasn't mentioned much, but you've heard through the grapevine that the
project in question has to do with the water line repairs scheduled to
reach the road where Jeff's car wash is next month.

You are a genuine and excitable person who loves mystery and intrigue
which is also why you recommended the first book for the club and why
you tend to binge-watch mystery dramas on Netflix.

You have a soft spot for your friend Jeff, but Jane can be haughty and
Bob can feel too "corporate" for you liking. You try to keep these
opinions to yourself though.

You have no patience for random devil's advocate position-taking if you think it's just "asking questions" or to be inflammatory.
